# OS-EX3
## HOW TO USE: 
    run 'make all' to run the server. The server will listen and will print "server: waiting for connections...". <br>
    Once the server is running, open a different terminal and run 'make client', the client will try to connect to localhost (127.0.0.1). <br>
    You can also connect manually to a different host by writing ./client <host IP>.
